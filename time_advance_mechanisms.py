"""
Discrete time advance mechanisms for airport simulation project.
This class will generate 6 hours worth of passenger arrivals, and store the data in two arrays:
- One for commuters passengers
- One for international passengers

For each passenger, also need to generate their wait times for each queue. Or is that done when a passenger queues up?

"""


"""
Goals
------

Generalize this code so it can be used for ANY queuing system.

Need to account for:
- How many steps?
   :: Spawn a Server-Queue System for each of these.... link these all together
        o  How many servers at each step?
        o  How many queues at each step?
             -- Make a class that holds each of these "single step" systems
             -- interface between these classes
             -- glue them all together with a start and end point
             -- make them each a member of the overall system and use the same time advance
             mechanisms I've already got in place.
